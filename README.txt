About 20 years ago, I wrote a replacement for the ztools suite of programs, 
in Pike (infodump and txd), eventually adding a decompiler. This is a port
of that program, to modern Python. When finished, it should be a drop-in
replacement. I don't plan to write a full-scale decompiler for it, but I
do plan to have multiple styles of output, including the traditional infodump,
a ZIL-like output, and an Inform-like output. It will also read reform-
style configuration files and display accordingly.
